# Best Neighborhood Group Project - Team Car Safety
The goal of this project was to come up with a data-backed answer for what the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is, this was accomplished through the use of one large metric (car safety) and multiple submetrics (level of speed limit enforcement and speed control, level of proactive safety infrastructure, and level of technological progression in traffic control).

## Datasets Used 
### https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-traffic-signs/resource/d078a6b5-83a3-4723-a3a9-5371cfe1cc0c
This dataset explores data on the Traffic and safety signs in each neighborhood. Neighborhoods with more safety-oriented signage are "better" because they have better-controlled traffic flow, prioritize pedestrian safety, are more family-friendly, and show city investment in resident safety. A traffic safety sign is a visual indicator placed throughout neighborhoods to control traffic flow, warn drivers of hazards, and protect pedestrians. Examples include stop signs that control intersections, "Watch Children" signs in residential areas, speed limit signs, pedestrian crossing signs, and yield signs. The more traffic safety signs a neighborhood has, the more controlled and regulated the traffic is. This means that the likelihood of accidents is decreased, meaning pedestrians and non-car users are safer! The submetric presented in this dataset is therefore the, "level of proactive safety infrastructure".
### https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh
This data set displays the daily driving tendencies of motor vehicle drivers in each Pittsburgh neighborhood. The idea is that speed limits are created to keep not only drivers safe but pedestrians and cyclists as well. If drivers are consistently ignoring these speed limits or are driving recklessly it leads to a higher level of danger for everyone on or around the road. My submetric is Level of speed limit enforcement and speed control.
### https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-signalized-intersections
A signalized intersection is a traffic intersection outfitted with different pieces of technology that help to control the flows of traffic present. The more signalized intersections a neighborhood has, the more controlled conflicting flows of traffic are. This means that the likelihood of crashes is decreased, meaning pedestrians/non-car users are safer! The submetric presented in this dataset is therefore the, "level of technological progression in traffic control".
